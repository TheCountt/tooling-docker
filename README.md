## CONTAINERIZATION WITH DOCKER

### Docker Installation

You can learn how to install Docker Engine on your PC [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

#### MySQL in container
Let us start assembling our application from the Database layer â€“ we will use a pre-built MySQL database container, configure it, and make sure it is ready to receive requests from our PHP application.

**Step 1: Pull MySQL Docker Image from Docker Hub Registry**
- Start by pulling the appropriate Docker image for MySQL. You can download a specific version or opt for the latest release, as seen in the following command:

```
docker pull mysql/mysql-server:latest
```

If you are interested in a particular version of MySQL, replace latest with the version number. Visit Docker Hub to check other tags

- List the images to check that you have downloaded them successfully:

```
docker images ls
```

**Step 2: Deploy the MySQL Container to your Docker Engine**

- Once you have the image, move on to deploying a new MySQL container with:
```
docker run --name <container_name> -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<my-secret-pw> -d mysql/mysql-server:latest
```
Replace `<container_name>` with the name of your choice. If you do not provide a name, Docker will generate a random one

The ***-d*** option instructs Docker to run the container as a service in the background

Replace `<my-secret-pw>` with your chosen password
  
In the command above, we used the latest version tag. This tag may differ according to the image you downloaded

- Then, check to see if the MySQL container is running: Assuming the container name specified is mysql-server

  ```
  docker ps -a
  ```
