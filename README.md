## CONTAINERIZATION WITH DOCKER

### Docker Installation

You can learn how to install Docker Engine on your PC [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

#### MySQL in container**
Let us start assembling our application from the Database layer â€“ we will use a pre-built MySQL database container, configure it, and make sure it is ready to receive requests from our PHP application.

**Step 1: Pull MySQL Docker Image from Docker Hub Registry**
- Start by pulling the appropriate Docker image for MySQL. You can download a specific version or opt for the latest release, as seen in the following command:

```
docker pull mysql/mysql-server:latest
```

If you are interested in a particular version of MySQL, replace latest with the version number. Visit Docker Hub to check other tags

- List the images to check that you have downloaded them successfully:

```
docker images ls
```
